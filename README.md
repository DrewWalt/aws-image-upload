Application I created in order to learn how to and test uploading images to an AWS s3 bucket.  The backend was created using Java, spring boot, and AWS s3.  The front end was created using react, axios (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios), and react dropzone (https://react-dropzone.js.org/).

Backend repository : https://github.com/DrewWalt/aws-image-upload-backend.git

Frontend repository : https://github.com/DrewWalt/aws-image-upload-frontend.git

Page must be refershed after uploading images as I did not implement an automatic refersh on upload.
